# VRC Photo Manager
 
A program which will embed world metadata into your vrchat photos and let you edit them and upload to Discord.

Still a work-in-progress project. Many core features are not ready yet.

### Currently working features:
- Detects new photos
- Automatically uploads them to Discord via webhooks
- Discord upload contains world information and time taken

### To-do:
- Embed world info into photo meta-data
- Photo browser
- Uploader for older photos
- Multiple webhook support
- Rotate photos
- More secure login storage (tokens?)
